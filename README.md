The main challenge regarding to improving the efficiency of energy storage devices is to discover new materials with the higher performance.
We can use the artificial intelligence and machine learning methods such as artificial neural network to discover new materials. This presentations illustates aa few example of material discovery in Battery materials, or catalisators.

1. Principal Component Analysis: Keras and home made code
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction method that is typically used to transform a high-dimensional data set into a smaller-dimensional subspace prior to applying a machine learning algorithm on the data.
