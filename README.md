# Material Science

The main challenge regarding to improving the efficiency of energy storage devices is to discover new materials with the higher performance.
We can use the artificial intelligence and machine learning methods such as artificial neural network to discover new materials. This presentations illustates aa few example of material discovery in Battery materials, or catalisators.
